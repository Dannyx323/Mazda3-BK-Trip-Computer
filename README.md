# Mazda3-BK-Trip-Computer
A basic trip computer read/display for Mazda 3 BK's that don't have one already, mainly Aus models, . It uses an arduino based board, a 16x2 LCD and a CAN-BUS shield to read the information from the car's computer and display it to the user. This also uses button input to cycle through information on the display. 

The shield used is the CAN-BUS Shield from sparkfun (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13262)

Required libraries:
- LiquidCrystal (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal)
- Sparkfun CAN-BUS (https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_CAN-Bus_Arduino_Library)
